Euthymia Technologies is a Canadian company that builds apps and software for mental health. So what does "euthymia" mean? Consider a mood disorder like major depression or bipolar disorder. These are episodic in nature - a person goes through periods of depression, but between those periods (with good treatment) they can have periods of relief and normal functioning. Those periods are known as euthymia, and it is our mission to make sure **<span style="color: #3366ff;">every person with mental illness experiences at least one euthymia in their lifetime</span>**.

It is estimated that 1 in 5 Canadians currently have a diagnosable mental illness, and roughly 50% of people will experience mental illness at least once in their lifetime. This is an epidemic with significant disease burden, which leaves people's quality of life in ruins and has a deep impact on our economy. If we are going to overcome mental illness as a society, we need to mobilize across all domains of development, from government agencies through to industry innovations. A future free from mental illness is what we at Euthymia Technologies are dedicated to contributing to.
