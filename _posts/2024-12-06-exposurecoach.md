Are you looking for an affordable introduction to Exposure Response Prevention (ERP) Therapy? [Preregister now](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf4DT1cn4eZzDL6itSMf_zad6aVkhKmBytc-atp78WdBXKLjw/viewform?usp=dialog) for ExposureCoach, the app which to guides you through personalized exposure exercises.

ERP therapy has been shown to be one of the most effective treatments for anxiety, ranging from specific phobias to panic attacks to social anxiety and OCD. However, it is also one of the most challenging therapies to get through due to the discomforting nature of exposure itself. ExposureCoach will help you get through the exposure exercises gradually with the help of an AI called Wolpe, who's named after [Joseph Wolpe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Wolpe), a pioneer of the method.

### How does it work?

You will first be guided through some basic questions by Wolpe: What are your fears? Do you have a diagnosis? What's your experience and goals with exposure therapy? and so on. Wolpe will then put you through a process of evaluating the best course of action, and tailor specific weekly exercises just for you based on your unique needs. You will then perform the exercises approximately two to three times a week and return to the app to decompress and have a discussion with Wolpe about how it went, and then you will receive a completion badge. As the weeks progress, the exercises will increase in intensity and duration until you are ready to conquer your fears in your daily life.

### How much does it cost?

We plan to price ExposureCoach for an up-front fee of around $10 to $25 USD. This is about the cost of an ERP workbook, and it's far more affordable than therapy from a clinical psychologist or psychotherapist, which can cost over $100 USD per session. If you have any input on the pricing, please comment directly in the preregistration form.

### What do I get for signing up?

You will get a half-off discount code sent to you when ExposureCoach is first released! You can also opt-in to our mailing list to received updates about our progress in building the app.
