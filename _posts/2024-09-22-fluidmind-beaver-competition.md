FluidMind now has Beaver Statuses! You will get a new Beaver Status for each unlocked grading of your all time question count. For instance: the first beaver status happens at 5 questions in total, the **<span style="color: #7dc0d5;">Blue Beaver Status</span>**; the second beaver status happens at 100 questions in total, the **<span style="color: #009933;">Green Beaver Status</span>**; and then at 500 questions in total you get the **<span style="color: #d94c42;">Red Beaver Status</span>**. In total, there are 10 Beaver Statuses.

I am now handing out gift cards for the first person to unlock the latest, highest beaver status. The gift card will be $15 for your choice of either Tim Hortons or Starbucks.

The current goal is: **<span style="color: #a56e40;">Bronze Beaver Status</span>**.

The first person to reach Bronze Beaver Status will win the gift card. Simply take a screenshot of the Bronze Beaver once unlocked, and email it to [fluidmindapp@gmail.com](mailto:fluidmindapp@gmail.com) to claim your prize.

The next goal after Bronze is: **<span style="color: #a39c8a;">Silver Beaver Status</span>**.

The all time question count gradings for new Beaver Statuses are spread out enough that it is impractical for one to simply spam the Answer Questions section. The best way to accomplish this goal is to answer questions consistently every day. If you answer 15 questions a day, it will take you about one month to get to Red Beaver Status. I recommend answering no more than 60 questions a day.

Share this blog post with all your friends who are using FluidMind so they know about the competition, and please also [join the Euthymia Technologies mailing list](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc_UeuhWo5PDJP3sC0wEQucxTSzrpN8GuuRPuxWjNIUD_L_Gg/viewform) for company updates.

Please note that resetting your history from the settings will also reset your Beaver Status.
