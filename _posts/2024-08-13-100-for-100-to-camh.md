I will donate $100 to CAMH, the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto, if we can get 100 new downloads of [FluidMind](https://euthymiatechnologies.com/what-is-fluidmind) by August 21st, 2024.

Download FluidMind (only available in Canada) on the [Apple App Store](https://euthymiatechnologies.com/fluidmind-100for100-appstore) or [Google Play Store](https://euthymiatechnologies.com/fluidmind-100for100-gplay) today! And please share this link with everyone you know in Canada who wants to contribute to a great cause.

[CAMH](https://www.camh.ca/en/driving-change/about-camh) is the leading research facility for mental health and addiction in Canada. It acts as both a mental health teaching hospital with a psychiatric emergency department and an advanced research institution that makes breakthroughs like discovering the D2 dopamine receptor. Each year, they help approximately 38,000 patients who suffer from debilitating mental illness and addiction.

Not only do I want to raise attention of my new mental health app, [FluidMind](https://euthymiatechnologies.com/what-is-fluidmind), but I want to contribute to CAMH's mission. Please help me do both! If we miss our goal but still make good progress, I will donate a smaller amount under [Euthymia Technologies](https://euthymiatechnologies.com/the-early-days-of-fluidmind-and-euthymia-technologies).

Once we've reached this goal of 100 downloads, I will post a receipt of my donation on my instagram page: [@euthymiatech](https://www.instagram.com/euthymiatech/) - please give me a follow! I will also email a copy of the receipt to anyone who signs up to my [mailing list](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc_UeuhWo5PDJP3sC0wEQucxTSzrpN8GuuRPuxWjNIUD_L_Gg/viewform).

Let's do something great together.
