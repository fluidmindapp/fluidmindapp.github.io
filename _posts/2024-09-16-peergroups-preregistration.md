Are you looking for an anonymous peer support group to help with your mental health? Do you want to get something about your day off your chest? [Preregister now](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfLyZDdjiYxpqUhJvux88yhl-z0LjoAYLZJTI7ybaM0WFPvOg/viewform) for our new app, PeerGroups - currently in development by Euthymia Technologies.

PeerGroups is an anonymous peer support group app where you join a small group of people about a relevant topic for you (like depression, anxiety, or substance abuse, etc), and post once a day about how you feel. Everyone in the group can respond or send you an "YNA" if they read your post and want you to know that You're Not Alone (YNA). The rules are the same as a typical peer support group: no talk of suicide or self-harm, no judgement, no advice, only "I" statements allowed, no politics, and so on.

There are other peer support apps, such as Circles, which provides professionally moderated audio call groups at a cost of roughly $40 per month. We plan to offer PeerGroups at a significantly reduced cost.

Are you interested? Preregister now by filling out this [response form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfLyZDdjiYxpqUhJvux88yhl-z0LjoAYLZJTI7ybaM0WFPvOg/viewform) and reserve your username.
